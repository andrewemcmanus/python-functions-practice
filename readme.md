# Lab: Practice

No need to turn this in! Instead we will go over as a class together on the whiteboard, so make sure you have working code that you can explain for both problems!

It is recommended to use [repl](repl.it) to write and test your code!

It is also recommended to work together with your classmates!

## 1. Fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz is often used as a basic way to root out job candidates - often before they ever even reach an interview! So it's to your advantage to be able to do this problem really well!

#### Prerequesites

* Writing a function in python
* Using parameters/arguments in python functions
* Writing a loop in python
* Writing conditional statements in python
* Using modulus
* Using print to output text

#### Prompt

Write a function called `fizzbuzz` that has a parameter `n`. `fizzbuzz` takes a numerical argument for the value of `n`, which is the maximum value to print up to. For example, if I gave you the number 10, I would expect your program to start at 1 and print up to 10.

Additionally, your function should do the following:

* If a number is divisible by 3, print `fizz`
* If a number is divisible by 5, print `buzz`
* If a number is divisible by 3 AND 5, print `fizzbuzz`
* If none of the above are true, just print the number itself

#### Example Usage

```python
fizzbuzz(20)
```

#### Expected Output

```
